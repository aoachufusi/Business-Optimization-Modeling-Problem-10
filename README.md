# Modeling Problem 10 Prompt
A small college in Maine needs to decide how much investment and debt to undertake during the next year. Each dollar invested reduces the NPV of the college by 15 cents and each dollar of debt increases the NPV by 70 cents. The college can invest at most one million dollars during the next year, and debt can be at most 50% of investment.

### Write and solve an optimization model to answer the following question:
If the college has $400,000 in cash available and all investments must be paid for from current cash or borrowed money, what should the college do to maximize NPV?
